         <p class="caption">Pasta Alla Zozzona. I wish that I was able to make homemade pasta, would've really been the icing on the cake for this one. Tomato puree, pancetta, spicy sausage, onion. Finished with an egg yolk and Pecorino Romano mix, giving it a deeply orange hue. Served with bread, basil, and Narragansett Del's Shandy (it was very hot outside) Again, my photography skills do not do this dish justice. Not Burned on 6-14-22.</p>

         <img class="image"src="unburned-food/food_photos/guac.jpeg">
         <p class="caption">Slightly fancy guac. Charred pepper + roasted garlic puree, the reason for the millennial housing crisis (avocado), salt + pepper, lime, cilantro. Made to be consumed at a celebratory end-of-semester cookout, and prepared in a hurry (but with love). I was sad I didn't fry up homemade chips. Nothing special, but definitely better than what you get at Chipotle. Not Burned on 5-15-22.</p>

         <img class="image"src="unburned-food/food_photos/khao.jpeg">
         <p class="caption">Khao Soi paste. Coconut milk and chicken stock as broth, with egg noodles, crispy noodles, and slowly cooked chicken drumsticks. Added fish sauce, cilantro, lime to taste. It was a miracle that this was prepared in my apartment kitchen, nary a sharp knife or cooking space to be found. Thanks to my roommate benjy for putting in effort when trying to capture this. Not Burned on 5-27-22.</p>

         <img class="image"src="unburned-food/food_photos/big_carrot.jpeg">
         <p class="caption">My friend Graylen took this photo. The carrot is the size of my forearm. It is, by far, the largest carrot I have ever seen. I cannot imagine what multiple PhDs were thinking when they created this genetically modified monster. "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should". The carrot was later used in a Golden Curry - 10/10 meal. Not Burned on 2-24-22.</p>

         <img class="image"src="unburned-food/food_photos/beef.jpeg">
         <p class="caption">Beef Bourguignon. Not Julia Child's recipe, but close enough. Made on NYE with lots of red wine, lots of butter, lots of beef stock. Overall a good way to end the year. Not Burned on 12-31-21.</p>

         <img class="image"src="unburned-food/food_photos/thanks.jpeg">
         <p class="caption">Thanksgiving in PVD. I won't take credit for this - most of this meal was created with the help of Whole Foods (TM). The string beans are slightly burnt but we needed vegetables. Disproportionate alcohol to food ratio, starchy food to healthy food ratio.  Not Burned on 11-25-21.</p>

         <img class="image"src="unburned-food/food_photos/hash.jpeg">
         <p class="caption">Hurricane Florence chorizo-bacon breakfast hash (made approximately 150 miles from the hurricane). This hash is the first time I’ve felt proud about making something. Yes, there were slightly too many jalapenos. Yes, the potatoes were a bit crispy. However, the cheddar finish and the general smokiness of the meal were good ways to distract myself from the fact that my hometown was underwater (at the time). We all gotta start somewhere! Not Burned (slightly fibbing here)) on 9-15-18.</p>
